For the side channel analysis, through the currently available tools for this task, this challenge should not be approachable (e.g. valgrind).
Probably a custom debugger has to be written that will extract the signal through the huge amount of noise (e.g. monitor the custom stack structure of the movfuscator)
Even though in theory should be possible, it should be interesting to see in practice if the movfuscated whitebox crypto can fall under the powers of SCA.
