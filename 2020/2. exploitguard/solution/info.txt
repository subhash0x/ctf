i have updated the challenge to include:

unhackable_old: this is the original version renamed, the EditPlayer functionality allows only the modification of the last created player which increases the difficulty of exploitation
unhackable: this is the new version, the EditPlayer functionality allows to edit any player.

the provided exploit works for both versions.
with the new unhackable binary, it should also be possible to get a shell.
